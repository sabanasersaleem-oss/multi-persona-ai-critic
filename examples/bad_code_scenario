# Example Scenario: Legacy Code Analysis

**Input provided to the Nexus Board:**
A snippet of Python code susceptible to SQL Injection and poor formatting.

```python
import os
def get_user_data(id):
    # connecting to db
    c = connect("admin", "123456") 
    q = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + id
    return c.execute(q)

print(get_user_data(input("Enter ID: ")))
Expected Behavior:

Dr. Zero should flag the SQL Injection (" + id) and hardcoded credentials ("123456").

Nova should suggest modernizing this into a secure API endpoint.

Atlas should critique the variable naming (c, q) and lack of error handling.
