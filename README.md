# 🧠 The Nexus Review Board: Multi-Persona AI System

An advanced Prompt Engineering project that transforms Gemini into a "Council of Experts" to analyze inputs from three conflicting perspectives.

## 🚀 Overview
Most AI interactions are linear. This project utilizes **Multi-Persona Architecture** and **Chain of Density** techniques to simulate a debate between three distinct AI agents before reaching a consensus.

## 🤖 The Personas
1.  **🕵️ Dr. Zero (The Skeptic):** Focuses on security risks, logical fallacies, and failure points.
2.  **🚀 Nova (The Visionary):** Focuses on scalability, innovation, and "blue ocean" strategies.
3.  **📐 Atlas (The Architect):** Focuses on structure, syntax, and implementation quality.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
* **Role Prompting:** Assigning deep psychological profiles to agents.
* **Constraint Satisfaction:** Forcing agents to find specific types of errors.
* **Structured Output:** Enforcing strict Markdown schemas.
* **RAG / Grounding:** (Optional) Using a knowledge base for evaluation standards.

## 💻 How to Use
1.  Copy the prompt from `system_prompt.md`.
2.  Paste it into **Gemini Advanced** (Gem Manager) or OpenAI's **ChatGPT** (Custom Instructions).
3.  Feed it any text, code, or business idea.

This project is open-source. Feel free to use the prompt in your own workflows.# multi-persona-ai-critic
